Deep Learning Models

## House Prices
ANN built using R and keras used to predict house sale price.
Dataset was aquired from the [Kaggle House Price competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## n2n_memory_network
End-to-End Memory network built with keras and python. Model is built with the `memory_model.py` script and analysis of model performance on custom data is found in the `Memory Network.ipynb` notebook.

## Stock Prices
LSTM model built using Python and Keras.
The model is used to predict the future values of a given stock price.
